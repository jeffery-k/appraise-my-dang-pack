  "text": "MAJOR SNOOZE WARNING V2\n\nThe general philosophy is to assume every accepted trade is a fair trade where both parties are offering the same value of cards as they are requesting. With this assumption we use an algorithmic approach to find the value of every card that would produce the fairest trades overall (fair being trades where the discrepancy in value exchanged is near 0).\n\nFirst I downloaded every trade conducted where the trade was accepted and at least one card was offered and at least one card was requested. I group the trades by the quarter and year they took place. For the first quarter of trades I set the value of all cards to 1 and computed the net of square errors between all trades. That is to say the difference between the values traded squared for all trades summed up. Via Pythonâ€™s scipy.optimize library, I attempt to minimize this net error by algorithmically adjusting the values of every card. The values that create the smallest net squared errors are used as the value estimates for the cards for that quarter. This process is repeated for every quarter, using the previous card value estimates for initial calculations. Finally, all values were multiplied by 10,000.\n\nv2:\n\nIn the new and improved v2, instead of comparing the values of specific mints we separate the values of card properties (sleeves, stamps, rarity) from the card types themselves and create estimators for both. Properties have both a flat value that they add to the base card value, as well as a \"shiny\" value which multiplies the total base and flat value. We also reiterate the optimization with different initialization values and trade groupings to provide a smoother curve between dates.\n\nLimitations:\n\nBecause value estimates depend on trades executed, value estimates only exist for cards that were traded and they only exist during quarters the cards were traded. I made no attempt to filter out blatantly unfair trades (aside from trades where one or both sides offered no cards at all).\n\nAlso, and this is perhaps the most important limitation, there is no accounting for heart <3\n"
